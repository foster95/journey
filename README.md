# Journey
This project creates a simple, entry level website for Journey, a community led drama company which provides a series of different classes for different ages in order to bring people together and build confidence in a safe, inclusive, welcoming space. The website is designed to give users an overview of each class that is available to access as well as to sign up to be part of the volunteer effort for Journey. The website uses bright, exciting colours, that are associated with fun, joyy and inclusivity. Across the website there are numerous images that are directly related to the classes that are available, as well as a hero image of the group. Finally the website has contrasting colours for the font to ensure maximum accessibility. 

## About Journey
Journey is a company that is based in London that provides drama classes for all ages, which aims to build confidence and foster relationships between attendees. Journey was created by one woman who stumbled into an improvisation class when she was going through a personal crisis and found a community that championed differences and individuality. She set up Journey the following year with the aim not being to create brlliant actors, but to build confidence and support anyone who is feeling a little lost and alone. 

Journey is directly inspired by Quest CIC, a community led initiative by my friend, which provides drama workshops to those young and old solely with the aim of bringing together people who do not have any sense of community. 

Journey reached out to me as they required a website which provided an overview of all classes, along with their contact details so that people could reach out to contact the company to sign up for classes. They also wanted to stress the fact that they are driven by commmunity and volunteer efforts, and they wanted to collect and encourage people to sign up to help with Journey's volunteer team.
