# Journey
This project creates a simple, entry level website for Journey, a community led drama company which provides a series of different classes for different ages in order to bring people together and build confidence in a safe, inclusive, welcoming space. The website is designed to give users an overview of each class that is available to access as well as to sign up to be part of the volunteer effort for Journey. The website uses bright, exciting colours, that are associated with fun, joyy and inclusivity. Across the website there are numerous images that are directly related to the classes that are available, as well as a hero image of the group. Finally the website has contrasting colours for the font to ensure maximum accessibility. 

## About Journey
Journey is a company that is based in London that provides drama classes for all ages, which aims to build confidence and foster relationships between attendees. Journey was created by one woman who stumbled into an improvisation class when she was going through a personal crisis and found a community that championed differences and individuality. She set up Journey the following year with the aim not being to create brlliant actors, but to build confidence and support anyone who is feeling a little lost and alone. 

Journey is directly inspired by Quest CIC, a community led initiative by my friend, which provides drama workshops to those young and old solely with the aim of bringing together people who do not have any sense of community. 

Journey reached out to me as they required a website which provided an overview of all classes, along with their contact details so that people could reach out to contact the company to sign up for classes. They also wanted to stress the fact that they are driven by commmunity and volunteer efforts, and they wanted to collect and encourage people to sign up to help with Journey's volunteer team.

## User Stories

In order to prepare for the project a series of user stories were created to help steer and guide all the development stages. These can be found below:

1. As a community member, I want to find out detailed class information so I can  decide which class to attend
2. As a parent looking to enrol my child in classes, I want to find out the recommended age range for each class, so I can ensure I place them in the correct group.
3. As a potential Journey volunteer, I want to subscribe to a newsletter so I can be informed about upcoming volunteer opportunities
4. As a potential community member I want to understand the aims and goals of Journey, so I can decide if I allign with them.
5. As a potential attendee of the classes, I want to read testimonials from other members, so that I can find out people's personal opinions of the classes.

# Design
The website has been created across three distinct pages, covering seperate aspects of the company. All of the pages are linked by a simple navigation bar which sits in the centre of the page. All of these pages have been designed with a mobile first outlook and have then been adapted to ensure they are responsive across multiple devices.

Every page follows the same page structure and brand colours ensuring a positive user experience across every page with easy access to return to the homepage.

## Wireframes
All wireframes were generated using Balsamiq:

## Brand Colours
Journey is an all ages drama group with the aim of creating a safe, inclusive environemnt. They are focussed on bringing joy to members. Whenever I think of joy, I think of the sun and it was therefore crucial that yellow be the primary colour for the website. The project therefore originlly began with a much wider colour palette:

**Initial colour palette:**

![Initial Colour Palette](https://github.com/foster95/journey/blob/main/assets/images/initial-colour-palette.png)

On begining the website with this colour palette however, the website quickly ran into a number of issues in regards to contrast, accesibility and user experience, with too many colours causing a disjointed and potentially poor experience.

As a result the colour palette was refined, adjusting the colours to ensure that the website could still keep the yellow as the primary colour, but the other colours in the palette would be complimentary. The final selected colour palette is below.

The colours are not quite complimentary, but sit very close to each other on the colour palette, so continue to provide a satisfactory user experience.

**Refined colour palette:**

## Typography
All font came from the Google Font library.

Barrio - was used for all headers and for the site logo. Bario is one of the first fonts that is suggesed by Google for a playful font that still has good readibility across all platforms.

Archivo - was used for all other secondary text. Archivo is a sans-serif font that is very simple and modern to read which contrasts nicely with the more decorative Bario font.

## Images
All images used across the site were generated using Gemini AI through Google, with various prompts such as: 

"create me an image of a drama group of all ages rehearsing"

"create me an image of an informal adults drama group"

"change the group to children"

# Features
Every feature across the website wad chosen for the simplest possible user experience allowing all information to be easily accessible to any user, regardless of the device they were accessing the site on.

## Navigation bar
The navigation bar is always at the top of the screen and houses the Journey logo, which adjusts to a range of screen sizes.

At all times the navigation system can be seen, showing the three pages available.

The header and the navigation bar are fixed so that they are always at the top of the screen regardless of the screen size.

## Hero Image
The home page utilises a hero image which spans the screen and reacts responsively depending on the screen size. The hero image has a layer of opacity over the top to avoid distracting from the bulk of the text further down the page. The image looks like it is part of the website, rather than simply sitting on top of the page.

## Who are we and Journey's ethos
As you scroll down the page, the user find a section which is a short summary of the company, giving any new user an overview of who the company is and why they should join journey. This is complimented by Journey's three ethos mission statement.

The misson statement sits in a flex box, allowing it to react responsively depending on the screen, moving from stacking to three columns on one page. The font size adapts slightly depending on which screen is used, but the h3 is always slightly larger than the small paragraphs underneath in order to draw visual interest.

## Classes section
This section provides a brief overview of all ofl the classes available. It had a photo which matches the class and a small section of text which provides some copy to sell each class to a prospective class attendee. Undeneath the text there is a smaller text box which contains the age range for each group and the days of the week the sessions are run. These sections are housed in boxes which model the click boxes used in the navigation bar to provide a cohesive feel acrosss the website.

In order to make this section responsive to different screens, the image size widens and expands for larger screens and shrinks for smaller screens. The text boxes are styled with flex boxes, allowing them to stack on smaller screens and expand into three individual columns on larger screens. 

## Classes information form
Underneath the classes section, there is a form which requires the user to provide their details (name, email, phone number) so that a member of the Journey team can contact them about each relevant class. All of the fields must be filled to allow submission, and on submit takes the user to a success page. This is the same success page as is used for the volunteer form page. The form is styled with the brand colours, and continue to use rounded borders to provide a sympathetic experience across the site. The submission button has styling to change colour when a user highlights over the submit button, further confirming they have submitted correctly.

# Support section
This section provides a brief overview of the volunteer opportunities that are available within Journey. As a community driven group, the majority of support for Journey comes from volunteers and therefore this was a crucial addition for the website. This section includes an unorderered list of all of the different volunteer opportunities available and is followed by a volunteer form

# Get involved form
Underneath the support section there is a form which requires the user to provide their details. Unlike the classes information form, this form does not require a phone number. This is because Journey want to talk to everyone who is potentially thinking of joining their classes, but they are more keen to simply gather information for the volunteers so they can contact them via email. All of the fields must be filled to allow submission and on submit takes the user to a success page. This is the same sucess page as is used on the class information page. The form has identical styling to the classes information form, to ensure a cohesive look.

# Success page
On completion of either form, a user is taken to this success page. This success page allows the user to know the information has been entered correctly and recorded by the Journey team. It features a button to return the user to the main homepage. This button has the same styling as the other submit buttons on the class information form and the volunteer form.
