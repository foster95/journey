# Journey
This project creates a simple, entry level website for Journey, a community led drama company which provides a series of different classes for different ages in order to bring people together and build confidence in a safe, inclusive, welcoming space. The website is designed to give users an overview of each class that is available to access as well as to sign up to be part of the volunteer effort for Journey. The website uses bright, exciting colours, that are associated with fun, joyy and inclusivity. Across the website there are numerous images that are directly related to the classes that are available, as well as a hero image of the group. Finally the website has contrasting colours for the font to ensure maximum accessibility. 

## About Journey
Journey is a company that is based in London that provides drama classes for all ages, which aims to build confidence and foster relationships between attendees. Journey was created by one woman who stumbled into an improvisation class when she was going through a personal crisis and found a community that championed differences and individuality. She set up Journey the following year with the aim not being to create brlliant actors, but to build confidence and support anyone who is feeling a little lost and alone. 

Journey is directly inspired by Quest CIC, a community led initiative by my friend, which provides drama workshops to those young and old solely with the aim of bringing together people who do not have any sense of community. 

Journey reached out to me as they required a website which provided an overview of all classes, along with their contact details so that people could reach out to contact the company to sign up for classes. They also wanted to stress the fact that they are driven by commmunity and volunteer efforts, and they wanted to collect and encourage people to sign up to help with Journey's volunteer team.

## User Stories

In order to prepare for the project a series of user stories were created to help steer and guide all the development stages. These can be found below:

1. As a community member, I want to find out detailed class information so I can  decide which class to attend
2. As a parent looking to enrol my child in classes, I want to find out the recommended age range for each class, so I can ensure I place them in the correct group.
3. As a potential Journey volunteer, I want to subscribe to a newsletter so I can be informed about upcoming volunteer opportunities
4. As a potential community member I want to understand the aims and goals of Journey, so I can decide if I allign with them.
5. As a potential attendee of the classes, I want to read testimonials from other members, so that I can find out people's personal opinions of the classes.

# Design
The website has been created across three distinct pages, covering seperate aspects of the company. All of the pages are linked by a simple navigation bar which sits in the centre of the page. All of these pages have been designed with a mobile first outlook and have then been adapted to ensure they are responsive across multiple devices.

Every page follows the same page structure and brand colours ensuring a positive user experience across every page with easy access to return to the homepage.

## Brand Colours
Journey is an all ages drama group with the aim of creating a safe, inclusive environemnt. They are focussed on bringing joy to members. Whenever I think of joy, I think of the sun and it was therefore crucial to me that yellow be the primary colour for the website. I originlly began with a much wider colour palette:

Initial colour palette:

However I quickly realised that I would run into a number of issues in regards to contrast, accesibility and user experience, with too many colours causing a disjointed and potentially poor experience.

As a result I refined the colour palette adjusting my colours to ensure that I could still keep the yellow as the primary colour, but the other colours in the palette would be complimentary. As result I refined my palette down to the following:
